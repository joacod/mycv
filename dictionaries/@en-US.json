    "title": "My Story",
    "story1": "It all started with a 486 PC my father brought home. While other kids were outside playing, I spent lots of hours on that machine, fascinated by the fact that it could run games like Prehistorik (I played that one a lot). That early curiosity about how things worked quickly turned into a passion for building them.",
    "story2": "Fast-forward past my Computer Science studies and early freelance gigs, my real education happened in the trenches. I worked on credit bureau systems across Latam, helped businesses launch websites in industries ranging from insurance to entertainment, and even contributed to the MetLife Stadium site just before Super Bowl XLVIII. Later came IoT infrastructure for smart cities at Aclara, job search features at Indeed, and streaming platforms at Warner Bros Discovery and PlutoTV.",
    "story3": "Fifteen years in, one truth stands out, software isn't about perfect code, it's about solving real problems.",
    "story4": "I've been a digital nomad, working with teams across continents and time zones. The sectors changed, but the principle stayed the same, if users can‚Äôt depend on what you ship, none of it matters. That belief led me to start Everbak. I was tired of watching brilliant ideas get stuck in endless ‚Äúdiscovery phases‚Äù. Two weeks is enough to validate if something has potential. If it does, we improve it. If not, we pivot or scrap it. No wasted time, no wasted money.",
    "story5": "When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm writing about the messy realities of software development, war stories from someone who‚Äôs been building stuff since that first 486 sparked a lifelong fascination. That same kid who used to mash the space bar to fight pixelated dinosaurs, now helps people ship products that actually work.",
